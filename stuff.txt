part probability distributions:
  mandatory (1, possibly backup) #cockpit, etc.
  redundant (at least 2, possibly more) #warship bridge
  primary (several) #ship's primary purpose: warship weapons, cargo ship cargo bays, etc.
  secondary (probably some) #related to ship's primary purpose: warship medbays, cargo ship refineries, etc.
  tertiary (possibly one or more) #mostly unrelated to ship's primary purpose: cargo ship weapons, etc.
  rare (possibly 1) #completely unrelated to ship's primary purpose: warship refineries, gravity generators, etc.
  none (0)

part:

generate ship:
  select type
  select class
  select hull material
  select parts
  select rooms
  assign parts to rooms
  loop until no more gyros/engines/reactors necessary:
    preliminary layout
    estimate total mass
    add gyros and engines
    estimate power consumption
    add reactors
    assign gyros and reactors to rooms
  finalize layout
